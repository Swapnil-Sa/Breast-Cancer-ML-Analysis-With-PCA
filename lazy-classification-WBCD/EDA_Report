### ðŸ“Š Sweetviz EDA Report  

As part of the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, I generated an **interactive report** using the **Sweetviz library**.  

This report provides:  
- Summary statistics of all numerical features.  
- Class-wise comparisons between **Malignant (M)** and **Benign (B)** cases.  
- Feature correlations and distribution plots.  
- Target analysis showing how each feature impacts diagnosis.
