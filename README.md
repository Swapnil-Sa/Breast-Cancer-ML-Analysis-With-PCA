# Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning

## Repository Overview
This repository contains a complete **machine learning workflow** for **breast cancer diagnosis** using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**. The project demonstrates **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection using Random Forest, dimensionality reduction via PCA**, and **classification using multiple ML models**.  

The project is implemented in **Python** using **Google Colab notebooks** and popular libraries like **pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn**, and **numpy**.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize distributions and correlations.  
- **Feature Selection:**  
  - Using **Random Forest** to identify the most significant features.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction:**  
  - Applying **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce data complexity.  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  - Lazy classification on original and PCA-transformed datasets.  
  - Models include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and more.  
- **Model Evaluation:**  
  - Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix for performance assessment.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Used:** [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))  
- **Description:** The dataset contains **30 numeric features** derived from digitized images of breast mass cell nuclei and a **target variable** (`M` = malignant, `B` = benign).
